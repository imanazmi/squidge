I am an aspiring data analyst based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with a strong foundation in data-driven problem solving and a passion for uncovering insights that drive strategic decisions. I hold a Master's Degree in Advanced Computer Science with Research from University of Hertfordshire, where I honed my skills in statistical analysis, data visualisation and machine learning. 

During my studies, I completed my final year project that allowed me to apply my analytical skill in a real-world scenario. The project involved comparing two (2) machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine to see which one produced better results when conducting sentiment analysis on movie reviews. During the development, I learned a lot about machine learning and data wrangling in general. I used R programming language in R Studio to complete the project for 1 year. This experience taught me the importance of data accuracy, thorough analysis, and clear communication of findings.

I am also proficient in other analytical tools such as SAS, Python, Excel, and SQL as I have 1-year hands-on experience with aforementioned tools during my full-time job at Protechnology Sdn Bhd. The projects that I did during my employment in the company have equipped me with the skills necessary to handle large datasets (as large as 30 million data), perform complex analyses, and present data in a meaningful way.

Beyond my technical skills, I am good at adapting to new environment and a collaborative team player. I thrive in environments where I can leverage data to solve challenging problems and contribute to data-driven decision-making processes. 

Recently (as of July 2024), I just completed a Power BI project that was hosted by Wanita Data Community on Discord and Instagram. This project involved analysing crowd trends on Klang Valley public transportation. During the 2-month project, I led a team of four people from different backgrounds to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on large datasets to identify trends and insights using Power BI. During the development, I managed to assist in dashboard creation and reports. This project taught me the importance of communication, responsibility and accountability between teammates. 

Currently, my friend and I are planning to analyse all sorts of data on a popular mobile game called Genshin Impact to see whether we can gain new insights.  

I am continually seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and stay updated with the latest industry or technology trends. My main goal is to become a data analyst who not only analyses data but also tells compelling stories through data, driving impactful business outcomes. 

Feel free to explore my portfolio and connect with me on LinkedIn or GitHub. I am excited to embark on this journey with like-minded people and look forward to contribute to innovative data projects.
