I am an aspiring Data Analyst based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
I used to work as a Data Consultant at Protechnology Sdn Bhd for 1 year before the company went bankrupt.
As a Data Consultant, I got to dabble my hands on new analytical software such as SAS. 
SAS programming was a new language to me but I managed to adapt quickly to the environment and did some ETL development on the complex datasets given by the clients.
I managed to extract, transform and load the raw datasets into meaningful data prior to using them as inputs to build models.
